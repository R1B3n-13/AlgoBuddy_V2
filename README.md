# AlgoBuddy 

An immersive algorithm simulation tool that visually demonstrates various graph algorithms and recursion trees with animation.  

## Features  

- **Graph Algorithm Simulation**:
  - BFS
  - DFS
  - Dijkstra
  - Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's algorithm)
  - Strongly Connected Component (Tarjan's algorithm)
  - Topological Sorting (Kahn's algorithm)  
- **Recursion Tree Builder**:
  - Fibonacci
  - Fast Power
  - Binomial Coefficient
  - Longest Common Subsequence  
- **Interactive Graph Manipulation**:
  - Supports both directed and undirected graphs 
  - Select and drag nodes  
  - Delete nodes and edges dynamically  
- **Internal State Visualization**: Displays real-time data structure states such as queues, stacks, arrays, etc.  
- **Algorithm Highlighting**: Synchronizes algorithm execution with a visual highlight to indicate the currently processed part.  
- **User-Friendly Controls**:  
  - Adjust simulation speed  
  - Play/Pause, Stop simulation  
  - Built-in recording functionality for capturing simulations as videos
